##### Charging Shield

###### Overview

Charging Shield is a deployable smartphone application designed to defend against privacy leakage caused by charging side-channel attacks. It can protect against some types of privacy risks: password inference, application detection etc. while balancing protection effectiveness and fast charging efficiency.

###### Defense Mechanism

Charging Shield implements defense by detecting user privacy-related activities during charging first, then activating random quantities of computational loads with randomized durations (including simple arithmetic operations, complex CPU-intensive tasks like matrix multiplication and cryptographic hashing) to pollute charging side-channel signals. These loads can mask the power traces generated by real user operations, making it difficult for attackers to extract privacy-related information from voltage and current traces. Meanwhile, it adopts an adaptive mechanism to adjust the intensity of computational loads based on the device’s real-time battery level, ensuring that defense does not significantly affect fast charging efficiency.

###### Usage Notes

To ensure proper functionality, it is necessary to grant Dropzone access permission to the application.
